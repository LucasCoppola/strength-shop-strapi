# Strength Shop

Strength-Shop is an E-Commerce website project built using React, Typescript, and Strapi as the headless CMS. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing strength training equipment. The project incorporates various features including loading state management, error handling, and efficient data fetching through integration with Strapi.

## Project Overview
During the deployment phase of the project, some difficulties were encountered with the Strapi setup, preventing successful deployment. Despite efforts to resolve these issues, they proved challenging and time-consuming.

To ensure a smoother user experience and overcome the deployment challenges, a decision was made to switch to an alternative data source. As a result, the project has been modified to rely on a simpler data source instead of utilizing Strapi as originally intended.

Please note that the Strapi version of the project is not currently deployed. It is provided in this repository for reference purposes, showcasing the aforementioned features and the integration with Strapi. However, please be aware that the Strapi version is not actively maintained or updated.

## Repository
This repository contains the modified version of the project that utilizes the alternative data source. You can find the code and related files in the [Strength-Shop repository](https://github.com/LucasCoppola/Strength-Shop)
